Lightweight case that has an integrated kickstand!
Improvements:
-fully model the cover, bezel dimensions here: https://github.com/AerospaceVillage/avBadge_2024/blob/main/bezel.stl
-extrude a few more holes or thin layers around thick chips that are still pressing on case (see bulge)
-Improve toggle design for less stress
-extrude holes for lanyard
